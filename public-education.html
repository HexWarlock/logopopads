              LOGO POP ADS transforms familiar public spaces, from parking lots
              and mall walkways to everyday high-traffic routes into interactive
              advertising zones where scanning becomes part of the experience.
              Instead of simply viewing an advert, you step into a live digital
              ecosystem where every scan opens a new opportunity.

              Through these QR-enabled moments, you can enter competitions, earn
              instant rewards, unlock brand discounts, and participate in South
              Africa’s verified rewards network. It’s a system designed around
              real people, giving you direct value from brands you encounter in
              your daily routine.

            <p>
              LOGO POP ADS is reshaping the advertising landscape by shifting
              the focus back to the individual, making you an active participant
              rather than a passive viewer, and creating a new, connected way
              for the country to engage with brands.

              When you move through a mall, parking area, or walkway, you’ll
              notice LOGO POP ADS markers positioned between bays or displayed
              on branded decals. These zones are designed to be fully
              interactive, giving you a quick and secure way to engage with
              rewards, competitions, and brand experiences on the move.

              on-screen prompts from there.

                Every installation is designed with safety as a priority. Ads
                are placed only between parking bays or in clearly designated
